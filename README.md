# ranger

ranger helps you to perform various operations (union, intersection, addition,
subtraction, ...) on boolean and numeric (scattered) ranges. Moreover, with
ranger you can translate numeric ranges into regular expression which can
be used to check whether a string represents a number that falls into a given
range.

# Usage

The following example illustrates how ranger can be used. The class
`AtomicNumRange` represents consecutive ranges whereas `NumRange` can represent
scattered, non-consecutive ranges (i.e., a set of `AtomicNumRange` objects).
For example, the range yielded by `r101.union(r4).toString()` would be
`[[+4,+4],[+100,+101]]{+4,+101}`. Note, that redundant `AtomicNumRanges` are
collapsed automatically. For example, `new AtomicNumRange(3,10).union(new
AtomicNumRange(2,13)).toString()` would yield the range `[+2,+13]`.


``` java
AtomicNumRange rinf = new AtomicNumRange();
System.out.println("1: " + rinf.toString());
AtomicNumRange r4 = new AtomicNumRange(4);
System.out.println("2: " + r4.toString());
AtomicNumRange r101 = new AtomicNumRange(100,101);
System.out.println("3: " + r101.union(r4).toString());
System.out.println("4: " + rinf.intersect(r4).toString());
System.out.println("6: " + new AtomicNumRange(3,10).union(new
        AtomicNumRange(2,13)).toString());
System.out.println("5: " + r101.union(r4).toRegex());
```

The output of the program above is depicted below.

``` bash
1: [-∞+0,+∞+0]
2: [+4,+4]
3: [[+4,+4],[+100,+101]]{+4,+101}
4: [+4,+4]
6: [+2,+13]
5: ([4-9]|[1-9][0-9]{1,})|([1-9][0-9]{2,})
```
